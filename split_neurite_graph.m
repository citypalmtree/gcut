function [ neurite_matrix ] = split_neurite_graph( cluster_graph )
%[ neurite_matrix ] = split_neurite_graph( cluster_graph )
% This function is used to split the neuron cluster denoted as a conneted 
%graph into branches by using the graph theory. 
% Input: cluster_graph - Neuron clusters denoted as a connected graph. The
% nodes in the graph represent the digital nodes in the reconstructed
% neuron cluster and the edges in the graph represent the connections
% between digital nodes.
%
%Output: neurite_matrix: Branch matrix, which represents all branches
%splited from the neuron cluster
