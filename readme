G-Cut is used for segmenting individual neurons from neuron clusters. 
The software is written in Matlab(R2013b).

System requirements: 
Prerequisites: any system with a functional installation of Matlab
Recommend settings: 8 core CPU, 16GB and above RAM.

Third party package dependency:
G-cut makes use of the Matlab tools for network analysis. 
The package is downloadable at the MIT Strategic Engineering Website:
http://strategic.mit.edu/downloads.php?page=matlab_networks

Installation: 
Download the gcut_source_code.zip, and uncompress it to desired destination.
We will call the destination installation_path. You need to add the 
installation_path to Matlab's search path by launching matlab, and (1) selecting
"set path" under Home tab, and using "Add Folder" to add installation_path
or (2) using command: addpath(installation_path) 
The same process should be done for Matlab tools for network analysis.

Usage:
----------------------------------general--------------------------------------
G-Cut takes as input an initial reconstruction of interconnected neuron cluster,
and segment the cluster into individual neurons. Currently, the accepted input
format is the swc format (see http://neuromorpho.org/myfaq.jsp. for more
information). User should also supply location of somas, obtainable via a
multitude of previously published methods. Multiple freely availabe softwares
can be used to render the file, most Vaa3D (vaa3d.org) and 
neuTube (http://www.neutracing.com/). 

Please be mindful when providing soma location in xyz coordinate format
(described below). Different software packages may set different coordinate
origins. It is recommended that the user validate consistency of coordinate
systems between the swc file and the soma coordinates. 
The authors suggest producing a swc file based on soma coordinates.
For example, if the user has two somas located at (3058.80054117, 2695.13645149,
27.0204870506) and (3405.51372501, 1796.63882945, 17.9294695441), a valid
swc file will look as following:
    0 274 3058.80054117 2695.13645149 27.0204870506 13.7277325535 -1
    1 274 3405.51372501 1796.63882945 17.9294695441 36.6107227682 -1
The swc files for the neuron cluster and the somas can then be rended with one
of the softwares mentioned above to ascertain coordinate system consistency.

-----------------------------------demo----------------------------------------
A sample swc file is provided in gcut_source_code/Sample/data.
Running the script demo.m (located in gcut_source_code folder) will generate
segmented neurons from the sample swc file, stored as swc files at 
gcut_source_code/Sample/result.

-----------------------------------API-----------------------------------------
To run G-Cut on your own data, use the script 
gcut_source_code/G-Cut/Neuron_split_sparse_beta.m.
If your machine has a minimum of 8 cores avaiable, you can use 
gcut_source_code/G-Cut/Neuron_solit_spare_sever_version.m, 
which runs the algorithm in parallel mode.

Both scripts takes three arguments.
[] = Neuron_split_spare_sever_version()(path_1, path_2, soma_option) 
% path_1: input data folder. must contain neuron cluster in swc format, and 
%         corresponding text file with soma information. The swc file and text
%         file should be named [cluster_name].swc and [cluster_name]_soma_ind.txt
%         respectively. Multiple neuron clusters can exist in the input data
%         folder, as long as their corresponding soma information files are
%         present 
% path_2: output folder. SWC file for segemented individual neurons are stored
%         in this folder as [cluster_name]_[number].swc, where number ranges 
%         between 1 and total number of neurons in the cluster
% soma_option - input soma information file type:
% 0 - soma_index: The node number of somas in SWC file
%                 if node 5 and 23 are somas, the file should be written as:
%                 5
%                 23
% 1 - soma_location: The x,y,z locations of somas
%                    if node 5 has coordinates (1, 2, 3) and node 23 has 
%                    coordinates (4, 5, 6), the file should be written as:
%                    1 2 3
%                    4 5 6
% Note that if multiple neural clusters and their soma information files 
% are present under path_1, they will all be processed.
